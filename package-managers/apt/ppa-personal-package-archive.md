- A PPA in APT is a user-created software repository that allows developers and users to distribute software, especially newer or customised version outside of official Ubuntu repositories.
- They are usually hosted on [Launchpad.net](https://launchpad.net/) or other platforms.
- Adding a PPA is essentially adding a new "app store" that APT can access.
